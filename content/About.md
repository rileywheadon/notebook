My name is Riley, and I study math at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. When I'm not busy studying, you can find me running, lifting weights, or enjoying the delicious food here in Vancouver! 

I created this site to share what I'm currently working on and write about things I find exciting. If you'd like to contact me, my email is rileywheadon@gmail.com.
